# ManpowerAllocator
Software to keep track of, edit, and place employees in positions based on jobs known, rank of job, and attendance records. This program will also separate employees by department and work group to make the program more versatile for different workplaces. ManpowerAllocator uses a bipartite matching algorithm to recursively place employees in the best position suited for them based on their working knowledge of a position with ranks of primary, secondary, or training. Four simple options in the main screen allows the user to be guided through the program:
